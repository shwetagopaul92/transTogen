transTogen: Python Tool to Translate Transcript to Genomic Coordinates
======================================================================

**transTogen** is a Python Command Line Tool that helps translate transcript coordinates to genomic coordinates.

For example, consider the simple transcript TR1, which aligns to the genome as follows:

.. figure:: images/example.png
   :height: 200
   :width: 600
   :align: center

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Contents:
